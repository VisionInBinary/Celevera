  "title": "Dhurandhar Box Office Update: Ranveer Singh starrer storms past Rs 500 crore after massive third weekend",
  "summary": "Ranveer Singh’s Dhurandhar continues its extraordinary theatrical run, raking in around Rs 36 crore nett on its third Sunday alone.\nWith this surge, the film has crossed the Rs 500 crore nett mark in just 17 days, taking its domestic total to approximately Rs 528.5 crore.\nThe third weekend has rewritten record books for Hindi cinema, comfortably surpassing the previous benchmark set by Chhaava.\nIt has also broken long-standing All-India records held by Baahubali 2, delivering historic daily and weekend figures.\nDespite facing competition from Avatar: Fire and Ash, the film’s momentum remains unaffected.\nIndustry estimates suggest Dhurandhar could cross Rs 600 crore by the end of week three and challenge Pushpa 2 (Hindi) for the all-time domestic crown, with Rs 800 crore still a distant but possible target.",
